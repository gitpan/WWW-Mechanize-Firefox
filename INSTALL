=head1 MODULE INSTALLATION

Installing the module is easy:

1. Download the distribution
2. Unpack it
3. Start a shell in the distribution directory

4a. With a recent version of the cpan tool, run
        cpan .
    there.

4b. Alternatively run the following commands:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

If you notice that tests get skipped and/or the module installs
but "does not seem to work", there are some more steps required
to configure Firefox:

1. Install mozrepl from

      http://wiki.github.com/bard/mozrepl/

   A direct link is
   
      http://repo.hyperstruct.net/mozrepl/1.0/mozrepl.xpi

2. Launch Firefox

3. Start mozrepl in Firefox by going to the menu:
   "Tools" -> "MozRepl" -> "Start"
   You may want to tick the "Activate on startup" item.
   
   
If tests still fail, especially t/50-click.t and 51-mech-submit.t ,
this might be because you use the NoScript Mozilla extension
and have it blocking Javascript for file:// URLs. While this is good,
the tests need Javascript enabled.

Solution:
    1. Open t/50-click.html in Firefox
    2. Allow Javascript for all file:// URLs
    3. Re-run tests
    4. No test should fail
