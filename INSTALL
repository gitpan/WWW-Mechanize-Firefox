=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

If you notice that tests get skipped and/or the module installs
but "does not seem to work", there are some more steps required
to configure Firefox:

1. Install mozrepl from

      http://wiki.github.com/bard/mozrepl/

   A direct link is
   
      http://repo.hyperstruct.net/mozrepl/1.0/mozrepl.xpi

2. Launch Firefox

3. Start mozrepl in Firefox by going to the menu:
   "Tools" -> "MozRepl" -> "Start"
   You may want to tick the "Activate on startup" item.
